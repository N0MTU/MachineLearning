# MachineLearning

This GitHub repository contains a collection of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. These algorithms can be used for a variety of classification tasks. Feel free to explore and use them in your own projects.

## Algorithms Included

### Logistic Regression
Description: Logistic Regression is a widely used classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome. It's a simple yet effective method for solving binary classification problems.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis
Description: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that is also used for classification. It finds linear combinations of features that best separate different classes in the data.

### K Nearest Neighbors
Description: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric classification algorithm that assigns a class label based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

### Decision Tree Classifier
Description: Decision Tree Classifier is a tree-based classification algorithm that recursively splits the data based on the most significant features to create a tree-like structure for classification.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
Description: Gaussian Naive Bayes (or Gaussian NB) is a probabilistic classification algorithm that makes predictions based on the Gaussian distribution of features. It's particularly useful for text classification and other datasets with continuous features.

### Support Vector Classifier
Description: Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space while maximizing the margin between them.
